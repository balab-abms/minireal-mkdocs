# Getting Started
This page shares a short path to deploy the MiniReal system on a server, and
get with running simulations. The simple steps to using the MiniReal 
system include:

1. Deploy the system with its components onto a server.
2. Log into the system with a default user created at deployment.
3. Download one of the Sample models that comes with the system.
4. Extract and compile the Sample Simulation Model.
5. Locate the model `jar` file and upload it to the MiniReal System.
6. Run the simulation from the UI.

The following sub-sections point to the relevant part of the documentation
to complete the above set of actions.

## Deployment
The easy way to deploy the MiniReal system is onto a single server. The 
[Single Server Deployment](./deployment/single_server_deployment.md) page
has all the relevant information to achieve this.

Once deployement is completed a default user with the following credentials
is avaiable.

!!! note
    `username`: owner

    `password`: changemepwd

## Getting a Sample Model
Once the system is deployed and logged into, a sample model can be downloaded
from it. The [Generate from Samples](./project_generation/generate_from_samples.md)
page shares the needed details on how to navigate the UI and open the sample
project on an IDE.

## Running a Simulation
Once a sample project is obtained, the respective `jar` file can be compiled
and uploaded on the MiniReal system so as to run the project. The
[Running Simulations](./running_sim.md) page shares all the information needed
to achieve this task.
